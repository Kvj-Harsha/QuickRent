QuickRent is a modern web application designed as part of an internship task evaluation by NIT K. The app allows users to explore various rental options and gadgets, with a sleek user interface built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various libraries like Aeternity UI, Hyper UI, and Framer Motion.

This project features front-end development with some backend functionality like authentication via Clerk and form collection using Firebase.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

The application uses the latest front-end technologies to create an interactive and responsive user interface. The backend integrates Clerk for user authentication, ensuring secure access. Firebase is utilized for form handling, providing a seamless user experience.

Key Technologies:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and customizable styling.
- **Aeternity UI** and **Hyper UI** for ready-to-use components.
- **Framer Motion** and **Motion** for smooth animations.
- **Clerk** for authentication (login/signup).
- **Firebase** for form data collection.

## Features üåü

- **Authentication:** Secure login/signup through Clerk to access protected pages like the Gadgets page.
- **Smooth Animations:** Using Framer Motion for beautiful UI transitions.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS for a seamless mobile and desktop experience.
- **Firebase Integration:** Firebase for handling form submissions.
